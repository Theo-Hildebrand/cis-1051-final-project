# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Super-Computerized Robot Assistant to Bolster Bookishness and Lexical Excellence (S.C.R.A.B.B.L.E)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The S.C.R.A.B.B.L.E. will provide the user the optimal opening play for a game of Scrabble.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The S.C.R.A.B.B.L.E. will take the user's rack as an input and compare it to a given dictionary of words, analyzing its permutations to find the best option. The program will then display this option on a Scrabble board, along with its point value, using state-of-the-art graphics. The full feature list will depend on how the project comes along, but I hope to include multiple dictionaries, perhaps, for the user to choose between, and perhaps the definition of the word featured in the play.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be for the program to take an input of seven letters and return the highest-scoring valid play using the NWL2023 dictionary.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be for the program to also accept up to two blanks, tiles which can be used as any letter, as a part of the user's input.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be for the program to not only consider point value with its suggested play but also strategic viability - does it really make sense to use your valuable 'S' tile to gain two more points? Here, the program wouldn't suggest plays that use an S or a blank tile unless they are sufficiently higher-scoring than the next best option.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'll need to look into getting a csv file of the dictionary I hope to use, but I imagine that's already floating around the Internet somewhere. I'll also have to look into how to get permutations from a given input string. Plus, there's the whole matter of making the graphics, which will definitely require some additional research.
