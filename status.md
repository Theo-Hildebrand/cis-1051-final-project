#### Project title

The Super-Computerized Robot Assistant to Bolster Bookishness and Lexical Excellence (S.C.R.A.B.B.L.E) - unless you're asking what it's called on GitHub, in which case the answer is the less exciting 'cis-1051-final-project'.

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Thus far, I've managed to get the program to find (one of) the highest-scoring opening play(s) and the associated score, given an input of seven letters as a user's opening rack in a game of Scrabble.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I'd like to find a way to implement blanks, along with altering the program to add a bit of strategy instead of just finding the play with the highest score (don't burn an s if it only nets you two extra points, that kinda thing). Then, of course, there's the matter of visuals.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None yet, but that doesn't mean they won't show up - fingers crossed.
