# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Well, I'm a big Scrabble fan, so I was thinking of doing something related - perhaps something that takes an input of seven letters and provides the optimal opening move for that rack? 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Well, my main questions are how difficult or easy this kind of thing might be and whether or not it's adequate for a final project, but I imagine that's something we'll go over on Thursday.
